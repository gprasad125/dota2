# Meeting 1 (6/25/22)

## Discussion:

Current Goals & Outline - 
1. Develop a new metric of evaluating a team's "advantage" throughout a game. 
2. Using goal # 1, predict the outcomes of matches. 
3. Compare the strength of our metric versus existing ones in predicting match outcome.

Timeline - 
# START:
## Late June - Early August (~4wks)
1. Streamlined and more focused "goal"
2. Full understanding of OpenDota API & what info is readily available. 
  a. Is pyopendota the best option? Can we use OpenDota & pay for more?

3. Preliminary dive into existing research on the topic (adjacent topics?)
  a. How has Dota 2 been handled in the past w.r.t. ML, Python projects, etc.?
  b. What kind of work has been done w.r.t. "super metrics" in sports / esports? 
  c. Let's make a database of our research (Git repos, published research, etc.)
  
## Early August - mid November / late December (~10wks)
1. Settle on complete API necessities & what is required to get the data. 
2. Begin cleaning process of data 
  a. Establishing new classes for handling complex API data (JSON strings, large CSVs, etc.) 
  b. Explore storage solutions (Git LFS, AWS, Cloud-based solutions, etc.)
3. Settle on EDA outline and planning
  a. plotly for interactive graphs
  b. Tableau for EDA?
4. Open discussions on ML solutions, deployment strategies

## Future (post-New Year)
1. Begin ML
2. Explore publishing options (FlashPub, Article, Interactive deployment)?
